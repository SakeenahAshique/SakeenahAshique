            <p>Hello! 

                It's great to meet you. I am a UIUX Designer and Coop student, studying Honors Digital Design with a minor in Cognitive Science at the University of Waterloo. I have worked for various companies and done some freelance work as an independent UIUX designer. I have worked closely with many senior product designers and UIUX designers on application design and feature creation for professional use. I am also an app UI hobbyist with a love for creating storyboards, style guides, wire frames, and high quality UI prototypes. 
               <p>Meet me as an Artist:</p>    
                <p></p>I believe there are many lenses in which I may introduce myself to an individual, one of my many sides is my creativity, hence this website. I am most passionate about oil painting. Oil painting is by far my favorite medium. It has this ability to be harsh and brilliant, yet soft. I have yet to find a different medium that I believe has as much depth as oil paints. My artist inspiration comes from personal experiences that have been shaped by my unique upbringing, heavily inspired by my experiences, religious beliefs, and a hint of my own femininity. I believe in thinking outside the box and allowing people to interpret art the way they wish, which is why I primarily pursue abstract art. 

            </p>
